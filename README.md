# Rust Tutorial
This console application supports basic mathematical equations and returns an answer. It keeps waiting for equations until the user forces exit, i.e. inputs Ctrl + C.

# Configuration
You will need to install cargo to run this application. You can find the procedure here: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html . I installed rustup-init.exe, and executing the file installed everything needed for Rust with Cargo. I also added a Visual Studio Code plugin to help me code in Rust.

All you need to do to run the application is go into the project's folder, and run 'cargo run'. If you want to make changes to the application, make sure you first run 'cargo build', and then 'cargo run' to run your application.
